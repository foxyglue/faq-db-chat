Could you provide detailed instructions or troubleshoot this issue?

Our team believes this will enhance collaboration and efficiency across departments. I have submitted this request in the #operations Slack channel and created a ticket for the IT and security teams in Jira. Additionally, I have attached documentation on the access requirements and usage guidelines: (1) A PDF summarizing the access levels needed and set-up details within GMail and GSheets (2) A document explaining steps that need to be taken to activate the services and an FAQ about the usage policies. Furthermore, I have created a Loom video at the link below that demonstrates the initial setup and usage of GMail and GSheets for project management. I figured this demo would be useful for the IT and Security teams conducting their review. Once a reviewing resource is assigned, please reach out to me to be granted access to view the Loom recording. Items #2 and #4 in the Loom recording breakdown below could be useful for the IT and Security team. The Loom recording is broken out as follows: (1) 0 - 5:00 Overview of GMail & GSheets features (2) 5:00-15:00 System-to-System Demonstration (3) 15:00-20:00 Pros/Cons (4) 20:00 - 25:00 Deployment Considerations Background on the access: -The access is required for seamless communication and data management within the project teams. -The proposed access will allow team members to send and receive emails via GMail and collaborate on documents using GSheets. -The access will not include administrative privileges. -The access can be granted to multiple team members as needed. -This is a one-way access; changes made in GSheets will not automatically update in other systems. -Can be scheduled to review access levels every quarter. Background on User Experience: -Employees will be given the option to ""opt out"" of this access within the project management tool. By doing nothing, they will automatically have access to GMail and GSheets. If they opt out, no access will be granted. -The access will appear as ""Enabled"" in the project management tool. -Employees can select their preferred settings in GMail and GSheets to ensure alignment with their work preferences. For IT/Security Teams: -Creation of a user group in the GSuite Admin Console is needed. -OAuth 2.0 credentials will need to be created for this project and shared with the Operations team.

Hi Alex👋,
Can you try applying the filters while in incognito mode (https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&oco=0) within your browser and let me know if that corrects the issue?
 
If it does, please try clearing your browser cookies and cache. If it doesn't, can you screen record the steps you are taking? You could use Loom.com (http://loom.com) if need be!

Thanks!

We have recently acquired a new office printer and need to set up user accounts for our team members. Could you provide detailed instructions on how to create and manage these accounts? Specifically, we need guidance on the following steps:

1. Accessing the printer's admin panel to initiate the setup process.
2. Creating individual user accounts with specific permissions.
3. Configuring default print settings for each user.
4. Troubleshooting common issues that might arise during the setup.

The steps don't have to match exactly, but they should cover the essential actions required for a smooth setup process.

Hi Team,

Alex Johnson is experiencing persistent issues with their access permissions in the enterprise cloud-based application. The permissions intermittently fail to synchronize with the external identity provider, causing disruptions. A detailed investigation and manual adjustment of the synchronization settings are required. Additionally, a review of the identity provider integration configurations might be necessary.

To resolve this, please ensure the synchronization settings are manually adjusted and confirm the integration configurations are correct. If further assistance is needed, contact IT at the IT Help Center (https://acme.co/it-help) or by emailing IT@acme.co.

Thank you,

Acme IT Support
